* Docker
> convert applications into docker images which can be run as docker containers on other machines with docker installed

* Commands
> docker {command}

** run {-d} {application}
> docker run nginx
- run instance of nginx application in docker container if it already exists
  - else we pull the image from docker hub and use that

** ps
- list running containers
*** ps -a
- list all containers

** stop {container_name/id}
> docker stop container_name
> docker stop 123456789
- stop a container

** rm {container_name/id}
> docker rm container_name
- remove a container

** images
- list images

** rmi {image}
- remove an image
  - ensure no containers are running off the image
  - delete all dependent containers

** pull {image}
> docker pull nginx
- download an image from docker hub

** exec {container_name} {command}
> docker exec ubuntu_container cat /etc/hosts
*** A container only lives as long as the process inside it is alive
- if the process stops/crashes, the container exits
