# Binary Search Tree

[BST Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHB0B1jFKQc)

## A node-based binary tree data structure

### Properties

1. Left subtree contains only nodes with keys lesser than root key
2. Right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than root key
3. Left and right subtrees are BSTs

## Types

### Full

- Leaves have no children/nodes have 2 children
### Complete 
- Heaps
- Nodes go top/bottom -> left/right

### Perfect
- All leaves on same level
- **Complete** and **Full**

# Traversals

- Prefixes tells us when we visit the node

## Preorder n l r

## Inorder l n r

- "n" the middle haha

## Postorder l r n

# Recursion tip: 

- Every frame has a different state
- Though every frame does the same thing, every frame will have different state at different points in the recursion
