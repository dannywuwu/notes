- A data structure where nodes/vertices are connected through edges
- No rules for connections (compared to a tree) 
- Any tree is a graph

> A graph $G$ is an ordered air of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges

$$$
G = (V, E)
$$$

## Edges

- Identified by 2 endpoints as a pair
- 2 types: directed/undirected

## Directed/Undirected graphs

- 2 types of graphs

**Directed**

- Edges are uni-directional/ordered pairs

**Undirected**

- Edges are bi-directional/ordered pairs

## Weights

- Can assign "weights" to different paths which prioritize connections over others 
- Unweighted graphs have all edges with the same weight

# Examples

- Graphs can represent any collection of objects having some kind of pairwise relationship

### Social network

- Undirected graph
    - Friendship is a mutual relationship (2 way)
- Users are nodes and friendship is an edge connecting them

### Webpages

- Directed graph
    - Webpages are nodes, links to another page are edges
